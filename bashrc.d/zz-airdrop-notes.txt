This isn't really a bashrc file, but I need to keep notes on this.

According to http://www.tuaw.com/2014/11/25/heres-the-root-cause-and-a-workaround-for-ios-8-and-yosemite-wi/

you can disable airdrop to get wifi working better.

Use this:

sudo ifconfig awdl0 down

You can then turn it on with

sudo ifconfig awdl0 up


Hopefully this won't be an issue after Yosemite fixes it's wifi.
